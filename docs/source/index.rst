Welcome to Test1's documentation!
=================================

**Test1** is a python project to test code and documentation quality for python projects. It is related to a blog about
setting up python environment, such that it reminds me to write 'good' code. It will not prevent bugs.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including how to
:ref:`install <installation>` the project.

.. note::
   This project is just a demo project to test quality checks on python code and documentation
